# Receipe App
- Created a recipe app using Jetpack compose and MVVM
---
## Features
- there will be a list of different dishes
- we can see a detailed recipe by clicking on them

# MVVM architecture
- we will try to cover the MVVM architecture of this project at a high level, covering all important features
## View
### UI
- At first, we have `MainActivity` as the base
- `MainActivity` is displaying the `ReceipeApp` screen using scaffold
- `ReceipeApp` screen is acting as a NavHost for `RecipeScreen` and `CategoryDetailScreen`
- `ReceipeApp` screen will show a list of recipes
- `ReceipeApp` screen has a base of box layout.
- Box layout is showing `CircularProgressIndicator` when data is loading
- It shows `error text` when there is an error fetching data
- It passes a list of categories to `CategoryScreen` when data is fetched successfully
- `CategoryScreen` uses LazyVerticalGrid to display recipes or categories in the custom layout
- LazyVerticalGrid loops through recipes and passes them to the custom layout `CategoryItem`
- `CategoryItem` uses a `Column` which contains `Image` and `Text`
- `Image` uses the `rememberAsyncImagePainter` method of the `Coil` library to fetch images asynchronously by just using the URL
- `Text` will display the recipe name
### Navigation 
- At the source, we have a single activity `MainActivity.kt`
- we are following single-screen architecture, where we have one screen MainActivity, it will swap or show all screens or composable
- `MainActivity.kt` will host and show all our app screens
- `MainActivity.kt` contains composable `ReceipeApp`
- `ReceipeApp` is acting as **NavHostFragment**, which means it will host the navigation and where the desired screen swapping will take place
- `ReceipeApp` contains the function `NavHost` in which the whole **Navigation Graph** is defined where `ReceipeApp` is its host
- `MainActivity.kt` is passing **NavController** to `ReceipeApp` or `NavHost` to remember the current position in the navigation graph.
- **NavController** is also helping to swap the screens as we move through the navigation graph
- **Navigation Flow or Callbacks**
- At first, we have `MainActivity.kt` which displays the `ReceipeApp` screen
- When we reach the `ReceipeApp` screen, its `NavHost` is triggered
- `NavHost` has a start destination of `RecipeScreen`, which will show a list of recipes
- In `RecipeScreen` lambda function or callback `navigateToDetail` is passed
- `RecipeScreen` passes this callback `navigateToDetail` to `CategoryScreen` after a successful network call
- `CategoryScreen` uses the grid to display items and will pass the callback `navigateToDetail` to `CategoryItem`
- `CategoryItem` contains a custom layout for each item. When the user clicks on the item, the `navigateToDetail` callback is called, with the category passed as a parameter
- `navigateToDetail` is the anonymous function which has input parameter of category and return type as Unit
- category is an object fetched from the internet which contains all the dish details
- `CategoryItem` is just displaying the thumbnail and dish name to the users
- `navigateToDetail` will reciprocate to its implementation in `NavHost` by `RecipeScreen` using lambda expression
- `navigateToDetail` lambda implementation contains logic to navigate to `DetailScreen` using **NavController**
- **Serialization**
- `CategoryItem` passes Category parcelable object to lambda expression `navigateToDetail`
- We need to convert the data class to parcelable object to pass between activities
- `navigateToDetail` is using `NavController` to save this data in the current back stack entry using a bundle where the key is `cat`
- In `NavHost` before navigating to `CategoryDetailScreen`, `NavController` is used to fetch `Category` parcelable object from previous back stack entry
- Later this Category parcelable object is passed to `CategoryDetailScreen`, which uses its properties like - `strCategoryThumb` and `strCategoryDescription` to display the image and description of the recipe
---
## ViewModel
- we have `MainViewModel` which holds all the data related to the UI
- `MainViewModel` is initialized by the `NavHost` `ReceipeApp`
- when `MainViewModel` is initialized it fetches data from the internet and stores it in the object `RecipeState`
- Error is stored in the `RecipeState`, if there was some issue fetching data from the internet
- `RecipeState` is a data class which has three attributes ie loading (boolean), list (category list) and error (string)
- when data is being fetched `loading -> true, list -> empty, error -> null`, data is fetched successfully `loading -> false, list -> categories list, error -> null`
- when error occurs fetching data `loading -> false, list -> empty, error -> error message`
- `ReceipeApp` fetches this read-only data using the immutable object `categoriesState` and stores it in the variable `viewstate`
- Later `ReceipeApp` passes this `viewstate` object to `RecipeScreen` to display the list of recipes, which later passes it to `CategoryDetailScreen` to show details of the recipe.
---
## Model
- we do not have repository-level abstraction, viewmodel is directly interacting with the model layer ie service class
- we have created a service interface named `ApiService`
- This interface is responsible for fetching data from the internet
- we have created a retrofit instance named `retrofit` using the base URL of mealdb
- we have then created a service instance named `receipeService` using this `retrofit` instance
- Inside the `ApiService` we have defined the suspend function `getCategories`
- `getCategories` uses @GET annotation, to customize the base URL to fetch required data
- @GET annotation can also be used to query or filter the data
- `getCategories` has a return type of `CategoriesResponse`
- `CategoriesResponse` is used to receive data from the internet
- `CategoriesResponse` is the data class, whose input type is the list of category
- we are fetching a list of category objects from the server
- Inside the `Category` data class we can define the attributes which we want to fetch, there is no need to describe all the attributes
- we can also define some extra attributes not present in the server, retrofit will handle it without throwing any error
- `getCategories` suspend function is called inside the coroutine launched by the viewmodel `MainViewModel`
- `getCategories` suspend function will run on the main thread, it will pause when fetching data from the server without affecting the main thread, fetching data will happen on a separate thread apart from the main thread
- once data is fetched `getCategories` suspend function will resume again automatically, transferring control back to the main thread and providing data to viewmodel `MainViewModel`
- Earlier callback method was used, which was called on the main thread, data fetching used to happen on a separate thread, once data was fetched, control was transferred to the main thread again.
- Coroutines are based on this same callback approach
- By default, all coroutines run on the main thread, if you want some coroutines tasks to run on more suitable threads like- Dispatchers.IO, Dispatchers.Default, you can use dispatchers
- The IO thread is optimized for disk and network IO off the main thread and the Default thread is optimized for CPU-intensive work off the main thread.
