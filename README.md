# MVVM architecture
- we will try to cover the MVVM architecture of this project at a high level, covering all important features
## View
### Navigation 
- At the source, we have a single activity `MainActivity.kt`
- we are following single-screen architecture, where we have one screen MainActivity, it will swap or show all screens or composable
- `MainActivity.kt` will host and show all our app screens
- `MainActivity.kt` contains composable `ReceipeApp`
- `ReceipeApp` is acting as **NavHostFragment**, which means it will host the navigation and where the desired screen swapping will take place
- `ReceipeApp` contains the function `NavHost` in which the whole **Navigation Graph** is defined where `ReceipeApp` is its host
- `MainActivity.kt` is passing **NavController** to `ReceipeApp` or `NavHost` to remember the current position in the navigation graph.
- **NavController** is also helping to swap the screens as we move through the navigation graph
- **Navigation Flow or Callbacks**
- At first, we have `MainActivity.kt` which displays the `ReceipeApp` screen
- When we reach the `ReceipeApp` screen, its `NavHost` is triggered
- `NavHost` has a start destination of `RecipeScreen`, which will show a list of recipes
- In `RecipeScreen` lambda function or callback `navigateToDetail` is passed
- `RecipeScreen` passes this callback `navigateToDetail` to `CategoryScreen` after a successful network call
- `CategoryScreen` uses the grid to display items and will pass the callback `navigateToDetail` to `CategoryItem`
- `CategoryItem` contains a custom layout for each item. When the user clicks on the item, the `navigateToDetail` callback is called, with the category passed as a parameter
- `navigateToDetail` is the anonymous function which has input parameter of category and return type as Unit
